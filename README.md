# OverwatchGallery

Overwatch hero gallery with both HTML/CSS/JS and PHP versions.

This project was developed during my first year at university as a web development assignment. It showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the PHP version added later to demonstrate additional capabilities.

**Repository Structure:**
- `html_version/`: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version.
- `php_version/`: PHP version with enhanced features.
- `shared_assets/`: Common assets like images and clips used by both versions.

**Changes Made:**
- Moved images and videos to the `shared_assets` folder for better organization.
- Decided to keep both HTML/CSS/JS and PHP versions within the same repository for simplicity.

**Note:** This project is part of my university coursework and serves as a portfolio piece.
